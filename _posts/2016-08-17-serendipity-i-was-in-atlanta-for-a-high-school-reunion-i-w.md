  Serendipity. I was in Atlanta for a high school reunion. I was visiting a
  class mate in an Air BnB. The condo owner happened to be a model. I mentioned
  that I brought my camera gear and lights and offered to take some amazing
  photographs of her. She said that that was a great idea and that she wanted to
  bring her son and his girlfriend down for photographs also. The more the
  merrier. This was a fantastic session. I got some really striking ones of her
  son Stevie. Move over James Dean.
