  Serendipity. I was in Atlanta for a high school reunion. I was visiting a
  class mate in an Air BnB. The condo owner happened to be a model. I mentioned
  that I brought my camera gear and lights and offered to take some amazing
  photographs of her. She said that that was a great idea and that she wanted to
  bring her son and his girlfriend down for photographs also. The more the
  merrier.

This was a fantastic session. I got some really striking ones of her son Stevie. Move over James Dean.

This is Anna. She is such a nut. Hilarious and vivacious. I did all of the styling. This is Cat Gurl. An hilarious photography session.

This was a really fun shoot. I brought out the fog machine - instant atmosphere. The samurai sword is a high frequency vibration sword that can cut through adamantium because it vibrates rapidly enough to split atoms.

Working with Kimberlie is amazing. She is such a polished model posing on cue. She is always ready for a new look. This seems desolate but we are actually shooting on the abandoned railroad tracks just outside of American Honda in Old Town Torrance. Smack dab in the middle of civilization.

Do you have a product that needs to photographed? In doors, outside, with a model? We can make that a reality.
